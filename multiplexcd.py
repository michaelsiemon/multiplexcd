"""Functions to perform multiplex community detection.

This module provides functions to simultaneously analyze the community
structure common to a list of igraph.Graph instances. It works by performing
spectral partitions of a multiplex modularity matrix, which is formed by
a block-diagonal arrangement of modularity matrices from each graph and
sparse off-diagonal entries that serve as the links between different
networks in the multiplex structure. It refines these partitions with a
Kernighan-Lin algorithm and by ensuring the connectivity of each community.
Networks may be symmetric, directed, or bipartite. Weighted and unweighted
networks are both supported. 

This module relies on the igraph_ package for python. With igraph
installed, an analysis of one symmetric and one directed graph might proceed 
as follows::

    g = igraph.Graph()
    h = igraph.Graph(directed=True)

    g_vertex_names = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    h_vertex_names = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']

    g_edges = [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c'), ('a', 'd'),
               ('d', 'e')]
    h_edges = [('a', 'b'), ('a', 'c'), ('b', 'c'), ('b', 'a'),
               ('c', 'b'), ('d', 'e'), ('d', 'f'), ('e', 'f'),
               ('e', 'd'), ('f', 'd'), ('f', 'e')]

    g.add_vertices(g_vertex_names)
    h.add_vertices(h_vertex_names)

    g.add_edges(g_edges)
    h.add_edges(h_edges)

    omega = 1.0
    net_list = [g, h]
    net_types = ['s', 'd']

    community_ids = multiplexcd.multiplex_leading_eigenvector(
                        net_list, omega, net_types)

To measure the multiplex modularity of an arbitrary community id vector::
    
    g.vs['memb'] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
    h.vs['memb'] = [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1]

    community_ids = g.vs['memb'] + h.vs['memb']

    B, mu = multiplexcd.get_modularity_matrix(
                        net_list, omega, net_types)

    Q = multiplexcd.multiplex_modularity(B, mu, community_ids)

The sets of vertices in each network may differ.

For bipartite networks, the vertices must be sorted by type so that the
block-diagonal portions of the network's adjacency matrix are all 0.

To alter the size of the communities returned by the algorithm, each Graph
instance may be assigned its own 'resolution' attribute as follows::
    
    gamma_g, gamma_h = 1.0, 1.5
    g['resolution'] = gamma_g
    h['resolution'] = gamma_h

where gamma_g and gamma_h modify the penalty for grouping unconnected vertices 
in the same community. Higher values yield smaller communities.
